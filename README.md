# Gene Classification Web Scraper

## Overview

This project provides a Python script for scraping gene classification data from the MIDB database website. The script automates the process of searching for specific genes, navigating through search results, and extracting detailed classification information for each gene.

## Features

- Searches for genes on the MIDB database website.
- Handles SSL warnings and certificate errors.
- Extracts gene classification information or reports "not found" if the gene is not listed.
- Outputs the results to a text file with gene names and their classifications.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome or Chromium
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) (for Selenium)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gene-classification-scraper.git
   cd gene-classification-scraper
   ```

2. **Install Required Python Packages**

   Make sure you have `pip` installed, then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content if it does not exist:

   ```
   selenium
   webdriver-manager
   ```

3. **Download ChromeDriver**

   Download ChromeDriver matching your version of Google Chrome from [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and ensure it's in your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. **Update Gene List**

   Modify the `gene_names` list in `scraper.py` to include the genes you want to search for:

   ```python
   gene_names = ["CDK4", "BRCA1", "TP53"]
   ```

2. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

   The script will:

   - Navigate to the MIDB database website.
   - Search for each gene in the `gene_names` list.
   - Extract the classification information or indicate "not found".
   - Save the results to `gene_classifications.txt`.

## File Descriptions

- `scraper.py`: The main Python script for web scraping.
- `gene_classifications.txt`: Output file containing gene names and their corresponding classifications.

## Troubleshooting

- **SSL Warning**: The script handles SSL warnings automatically. If you encounter issues, make sure ChromeDriver and Google Chrome versions match.
- **Element Not Found**: Ensure the XPaths used in the script match the current structure of the website. Update the XPaths in `scraper.py` if needed.
